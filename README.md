Building An LLM From Scratch

## Acknowledgements

This project is inspired by [Vizuara](https://www.youtube.com/@Vizuara) and his educational content on building LLMs from scratch.  
I’m following along to understand the core concepts step by step, while also exploring areas where I can expand, experiment, and add my own implementations.
